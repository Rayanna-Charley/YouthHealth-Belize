    <p class="four"> Even though, in Belize Mental Health awareness is becoming more talked about and many organizations are trying to educate Belizeans on mental health. I feel that we need to work harder having more awareness.  Many have the common misconception that teens are not affected or can’t have a mental illness. Unfortunately, this current COVID-19 pandemic has been negatively affecting their mental health. It is not only the pandemic affecting them but many other factors that can affect their mental health. Students are constantly under a lot of pressure from school, parents, etc and are ignoring their mental health.  As a student myself, I know how stressful online school can be and often find myself putting my mental health last. We need to remember Mental Health is so IMPORTANT!! I hope to be able to educate students, teachers, parents and anyone else on why our mental health is important and to seek help when we need it.  We are a non-profit organization trying to help spread awareness on mental health and how it can affects teens especially in Belize
